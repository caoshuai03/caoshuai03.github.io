# 🧍️ About Me

I am a senior undergraduate student majoring in Information and Computing Science at the College of Science, Sichuan Agricultural University. I will pursue a master's degree in the [LIPLAB Laboratory](http://liplab.site/), School of Software, Nanjing University in September 2025.

My research interests include:
* Software Engineering
* Computer Vision 
* Fine-tuning of large models

I also enjoy various activities, such as playing table tennis, working out, and listening to music. Additionally, I have experience with several different ball games. I was fortunate to grow up in the picturesque city of [Rongchang](http://www.rongchang.gov.cn/zjrc/), located in the southern part of China.
