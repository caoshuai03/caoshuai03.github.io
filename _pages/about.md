# 🧍️ About

I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information and Computing Science at the College of Science, Sichuan Agricultural University, Ya'an, Sichuan Province, China.

My research interests include
* Computer Vision 
* Fine-tuning of large models

I also enjoy a variety of activities such as watching movies, listening to music, and playing table tennis. Additionally, I have experience with several different ball games. I was fortunate to grow up in the picturesque city of [Rongchang](http://www.rongchang.gov.cn/zjrc/), located in the southern part of China.
